	Be ready to evolve,
	Always work as a team,
	Improvement is necessary,
	Ask the dumb question,
	Don't underestimate the power of design skills,
	Work closely with your customers,
	Go beyond just writing code,
	Pay close attention to the architecture,
	Consider accessibility,
	A cup of tea makes everything better,
	Smile and the whole world smiles with you,
	Why fit in when you were born to stand out - Dr Seuss,";
