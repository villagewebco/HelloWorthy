# HelloWorthy
=== Hello Worthy ===

A test plugin based on the Hello Dolly WordPress plugin - original version from @worthyontheweb

== Description ==

When activated you will randomly see a comment, quote, phrase or lyric in the upper right of your admin screen on every page. This is based on the Hello Dolly plugin that comes as a standard install of all WordPress installations. Instead of lyrics to the song Hello, Dolly, this plugin will display a quote, reminder or other comment. 

This plugin is essentially pointless, but good practice for those learning the basics of how WordPress plugins work and also provides opportunities to use GitHub for forking repos, editing code and committing changes. 

More information on the background to the Hello Worthy plugin is available in the wiki.
